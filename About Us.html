          <h2>About us</h2>
            We are a small private company with a multi-cultural and multi-national background. Our core values are quality, client satisfaction, integrity, and community welfare. We work in partnership with our associates in the Armenia, Ireland, Philippines, Malaysia, and the United States to optimize the skill-set and input needed for an assignment.  We have 60+ years of cumulative experience with private firms and governments in more than 50 countries, and take pride in the quality and integrity of the services provided over the years. 
            We believe in contributing to the welfare of the community and preservation of the environment in which we operate. C&S initiated ideas to Reality (i2R), a fund that provides money annually for three youth aged between 17 and 22 to conceptualize an idea that has the potential for further advancement, links them up with potential developers. C&S also organizes “Clean Your Beach” events around Sri Lanka to help clean up severely polluted and degraded costal sections and provide sustainable solutions for restoring the natural beauty and preventing further degradation.  
            We also believe that continuing education and training for staff are fundamental for the success of any organization. Our staff remain abreast of the advances in our areas of expertise through in-house research and learning.  They participate in international conferences and knowledge sharing events. Our staff are members of international and national professional bodies, and serve on technical committees.
